# Data Scientist Capstone Nanodegree

1. libraries used

The necessary libraries that were used are : 
numpy, pandas, train_test_split, json, sklearn, matplotlib,seaborn, datetime and math.

2. motivation for the project
this project will find what is the most popular offer type between bogo, informationl and discount. Also, the data is a mimics
for the customer behavior on the Starbucks app. A model will be created to help predicting customers favourite type of offer
but first an exploration must be made on the data then data cleaning after that analysis and modeling in the end.


3. files in the repository
the data sets that are used in the notebook are : ( those are not uploaded in the github)
portfolio.json
profile.json
transcript.json
there is only one notebook and two png that were already used

4. summary of the results
in this project i explored and wrangled Data then analysed in the end i did modeling for the data
in explore and wrangle data i cleaned the data such as dropping uncessery columns and changing the
type of data then in the analyzation i analysed all of profile,portfolio and transcript and found 
that bogo and discount offers are the most that people want but informationl is the least also that
event in offer completed is the lowest and the hieghest is transaction after that the modeling shows 
that K-NN classifier and SVM classifier have an accuracy of 100%. So, from the previous i concluded 
that offers to customers should be made more on bogo and discount offers because they are the most favourite.
